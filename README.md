Emotion Detection and AI Feedback System
This project is a real-time emotion detection system that uses DeepFace for facial emotion recognition and provides personalized AI-driven feedback based on detected emotions. It includes a smoothing mechanism for steady results and generates a session summary with visualized emotion trends.

Features
Real-Time Emotion Detection: Uses DeepFace to recognize emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) from a live video feed.
Interactive AI Feedback: Provides custom feedback based on detected emotions to enhance user experience.
Steady Emotion Tracking: Includes a smoothing mechanism to avoid rapid changes and deliver stable feedback.
Session Summary and Visualization: At the end of each session, a summary report and bar chart display emotion trends.
Technologies Used
Python for programming
OpenCV for video processing
DeepFace for emotion analysis
Matplotlib for visualizing emotion trends
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emotion-Detection-AI-Feedback.git
cd Emotion-Detection-AI-Feedback
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure a Webcam is Available: The system uses a webcam for real-time video input.

Usage
To start the emotion detection system:

bash
Copy code
python emotion_detection_feedback.py
Press 'q' to exit the video feed at any time.
After the session, view a summary report with a bar chart showing the frequency of each detected emotion.
Example Output
Live Emotion Detection: Displays detected emotion with personalized feedback in real-time.
Session Summary: Shows total time spent in each emotion with a bar chart for visual analysis.
